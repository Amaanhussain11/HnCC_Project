## Deployment

To Run This Project In VS code 

```bash
First of all take all the codes to your local machine (VS code 
preffered)

The second step is to install the extension of "live server"
from the Extension section in VS code. Now we can see 
a little "GO LIVE" button to the right bottom in our VS code
window. 

We have to install another extension of VS code named 
"Rapid API" through which we can fetch the data of the API 
we are using. After installing the extension, now we need 
our API host.

Here I am using an API called "Weather By API Ninjas". First
we need to create an account in the website called "Rapid API".
After creating the account we have to search for "Weather" in 
the Search bar. Now we have to select "Weather By API Ninjas".

Now we just have to get the "API key" and the "API host"
from "Rapid API" website and put these two in our VS code 
extension. Now we are ready to shoot!
 
Now select the "index.html" file from the file section in 
VS code and click on the "Go Live" button OR we can just 
"Right Click" on the window and can click on the "Go Live"
button.
